# Most Favorable Labor Trainings for Refugees

This project originally sparked interest in me while working with the International Rescue Committee. Unlike the clients that I served, refugees come to the U.S with their paperwork ready to enter the workforce. These individuals are often leaving countries with armed conflict, they have been displaced and their version of "home" is something they will never get to set eyes on again. It's important that we help serve these members in their community to work towards goals that will help them achieve success rather than survival.
